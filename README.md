This is a fork of cryptocoinserver/jesse-optuna, updated to be compatible with newer versions of Jesse.

# Jesse optuna

Only works with the new GUI version of jesse.
Use optuna directly to work with the results and create [visualisations](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/10_key_features/005_visualization.html) of the results. Jupyter Notebook might be usefull here.

You need the study name and storage, which you set in the config.yml, to load it for that:

```
    study_name = f"{cfg['strategy_name']}-{cfg['exchange']}-{cfg['symbol']}-{cfg['timeframe']}"
    storage = f"postgresql://{cfg['postgres_username']}:{cfg['postgres_password']}@{cfg['postgres_host']}:{cfg['postgres_port']}/{cfg['postgres_db_name']}"
```

The config.yml should be self-explainatory.

# Installation

# install from git
